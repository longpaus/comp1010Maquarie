# Assignment 2 (Worth 10%)

## Scope

Assignment 2 covers everything from week 1 to week 4 of lectures and week 1 to 5 of practical classes. You may use recursion but it's not required.

## League Table Analysis

You don't need to play, watch or even like football in order to do this assignment.

This assignment deals with real-life football data procured from [https://www.football-data.co.uk/](https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php).

### Introduction

Professional football leagues around the world have N number of teams, each playing twice with every other team, once at their own ground, and once at the other team's ground.

When they play at their own ground, they are the *home team* and the opposition is the *away team*. When they play at the other team's ground, the roles are switched. Number of goals scored by the home team are *home goals* and the number of goals scored by the away team are *away goals*.

### Point system

- If a team scores more goals than the opposition, they win, and get 3 points. 
- If a team scores the same number of goals as the opposition, they draw, and get 1 point.
- If a team scores more goals than the opposition, they lose, and get 0 points.

## Points table

The points table is maintained during the entire season and at the end of the season, the team with highest points wins the league.

There are different rules in different countries about what happens when multiple teams have the same (maximum) number of points, and we don't need to worry about this.

## Data set

All the tests are based on the data for English Premier League (in folder `EPL`).

Data set for LaLiga is also provided in folder `laLiga`.

## Stages

### Stages 1, 2

Stages 1 and 2 are based on week 3 lecture with one or two components from week 4 lecture.

### Stages 3, 4, 5

Stages 3 to 5 are based on weeks 3 and 4 lectures.

## Use of built-in ArrayList class is prohibited

Make sure you do not create or use any ArrayList objects in the assignment. Standard rules apply to this assignment.
