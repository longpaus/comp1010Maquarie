### Introduction

Assignment 1 is the shortest of the three assignments and students are tasked with completing five functions inside `PieGenerator.java`. After completing each function, you can,

1. Run `PieGeneratorTest.java` as JUnit test and see if the corresponding test passes.
2. Run `PieGenerator.java` and see the Applet output.

These arrays are already read and ready for you to operate on.

Please read the "Rules applicable to all assignment and weekly submissions" on iLearn very carefully. It's very easy to avoid the problems. Create a checklist and tick off each item to ensure you don't get caught out.

### Use of helper functions

You can add other functions that the functions you need to complete then call. In fact, this is encouraged and makes coding more efficient through delegation.

### File to be submitted

Submit only one file - `PieGenerator.java`. Do not submit any other file. Do not submit the test file.

Checkpoint: For students who submit by 23:55 (11:55pm) on 10th August, 2022, we will run an early automarker iteration and provide the mark on iLearn by 23:55 on 11th August. You can use that to update your submission.
